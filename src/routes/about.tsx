          ScanTap is built in Kenya, for Kenyan riders. Every day boda riders move millions of people across Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu and beyond — but getting paid still means shouting numbers, mistyped digits, and lost trips.

          We make a small, durable QR sticker that lives on your bike. It points to a profile that you control. Customers scan, copy your number in one tap, and pay you on whichever wallet you already use.
        </p>
        <h2 className="mt-10 text-2xl font-bold">Our vision</h2>
        <p className="mt-3 text-muted-foreground">
          Tomorrow, ScanTap will accept payments inside the app — receipts, history, and (eventually) loans built around your real earnings. We'll also expand to mama-mboga, mechanics, salons, and any service worker who needs a fair, no-commission way to get paid.
